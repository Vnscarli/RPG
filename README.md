# Rolling Dice for RPG 
 This repository focuses on creating simple solution for calculating the possibilities of an RPG player to pass a test. It only includes possibilities for rolling 1 or 2 dice.


## Calculating Average Value
The "AverageRPGRoll2Dice.cpp" code is designed to compute the average value resulting from the roll of two dice, taking into consideration the size of the dice. It uses a function that calculates and returns that value. 


## Calculating Possibility to Pass a Test
The "RollTheDice.cpp" code computes the likelihood of a player succeeding in a test with a specified difficulty level, treated as the target value. It is adaptable for various RPG dice by adjusting the number of faces. Additionally, users can choose to roll either one or two dice, and the code provides the probability of the player passing the test within the range of 0 to 1.
